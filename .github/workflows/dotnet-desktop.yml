The error in your GitHub Actions job is due to an issue with the `WriteAllBytes` method in a PowerShell script, where it cannot find the specified path. Specifically, the path `D:\\a\\SecureWaveAPI\\SecureWaveAPI\\SecureWaveAPI.Package\\GitHubActionsWorkflow.pfx` does not exist.

Here is a solution to address this issue:

1. **Ensure the directory exists before writing the file**:
   Modify your PowerShell script to check and create the directory if it does not exist. This can prevent the "Could not find a part of the path" error.

```powershell
$certificatePath = "D:\\a\\SecureWaveAPI\\SecureWaveAPI\\SecureWaveAPI.Package\\GitHubActionsWorkflow.pfx"

# Ensure the directory exists
$directoryPath = [System.IO.Path]::GetDirectoryName($certificatePath)
if (-not (Test-Path -Path $directoryPath)) {
    New-Item -ItemType Directory -Path $directoryPath -Force
}

# Write the certificate bytes to the file
[IO.File]::WriteAllBytes($certificatePath, $pfx_cert_byte)
```

2. **Review the workflow file**:
   Ensure that the workflow file `.github/workflows/dotnet-desktop.yml` correctly sets up the necessary environment and paths.

Here's how the updated script would look like in the workflow file:

```yaml
name: .NET Core Desktop

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: windows-latest

    steps:
      - name: Checkout repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v2

      - name: Setup .NET
        uses: actions/setup-dotnet@v2
        with:
          dotnet-version: '6.0.x'

      - name: Restore dependencies
        run: dotnet restore

      - name: Build
        run: dotnet build --configuration Release --no-restore

      - name: Ensure directory and write certificate
        shell: pwsh
        run: |
          $certificatePath = "D:\\a\\SecureWaveAPI\\SecureWaveAPI\\SecureWaveAPI.Package\\GitHubActionsWorkflow.pfx"

          # Ensure the directory exists
          $directoryPath = [System.IO.Path]::GetDirectoryName($certificatePath)
          if (-not (Test-Path -Path $directoryPath)) {
              New-Item -ItemType Directory -Path $directoryPath -Force
          }

          # Write the certificate bytes to the file
          [IO.File]::WriteAllBytes($certificatePath, $pfx_cert_byte)
```

By ensuring the directory path exists before attempting to write the file, you can avoid the error and allow the job to complete successfully.
