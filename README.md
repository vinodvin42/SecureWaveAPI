In a **Privileged Access Management (PAM)** application, users are categorized based on their roles, responsibilities, and access levels. Below are the **types of users** typically considered in a PAM system, along with their roles and permissions:

---

### **1. Admin (Administrator)**
- **Role**: Admin
- **Description**: Has full access to the system and can manage all aspects of the application.
- **Permissions**:
  - Create, update, and delete users.
  - Assign roles and permissions to users.
  - Manage resources (e.g., servers, databases).
  - View and manage audit logs.
  - Approve or deny access requests.
  - Configure system settings (e.g., password policies, 2FA).

---

### **2. Auditor**
- **Role**: Auditor
- **Description**: Has read-only access to monitor and audit system activities.
- **Permissions**:
  - View user activities and audit logs.
  - Generate compliance reports.
  - Monitor access requests and sessions.
  - Cannot modify any data or settings.

---

### **3. User (Standard User)**
- **Role**: User
- **Description**: Has limited access to the system based on their assigned permissions.
- **Permissions**:
  - Request access to resources.
  - View their own access requests and sessions.
  - Cannot manage users, roles, or resources.

---

### **4. Privileged User**
- **Role**: Privileged User
- **Description**: Has elevated access to specific resources or systems.
- **Permissions**:
  - Access privileged resources (e.g., servers, databases).
  - Perform administrative tasks on assigned resources.
  - Cannot manage users or roles globally.

---

### **5. Application User (Service Account)**
- **Role**: Application User
- **Description**: Represents non-human users (e.g., applications, services) that require access to resources.
- **Permissions**:
  - Access specific resources (e.g., APIs, databases).
  - Cannot log in or perform human actions.

---

### **6. Guest User**
- **Role**: Guest
- **Description**: Temporary users with limited access for a specific period.
- **Permissions**:
  - Access specific resources for a limited time.
  - Cannot modify any data or settings.

---

---




### **Considerations for User Management**
1. **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**:
   - Assign roles to users based on their responsibilities.
   - Define permissions for each role.

2. **Least Privilege Principle**:
   - Grant users the minimum access required to perform their tasks.

3. **Temporary Access**:
   - Provide time-bound access for guest users or contractors.

4. **Audit and Monitoring**:
   - Track user activities and access requests for compliance and security.

5. **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)**:
   - Enforce 2FA for privileged users and administrators.

6. **Password Policies**:
   - Implement strong password policies (e.g., minimum length, complexity).

7. **Service Accounts**:
   - Use application users (service accounts) for non-human access.

---

### **Example User Scenarios**
1. **Admin**:
   - Creates a new user and assigns the "Auditor" role.
   - Configures password policies and enables 2FA.

2. **Auditor**:
   - Reviews audit logs to ensure compliance with security policies.
   - Generates a report of all access requests for the past month.

3. **User**:
   - Requests access to a production server.
   - Views their active sessions and access history.

4. **Privileged User**:
   - Accesses a database to perform maintenance tasks.
   - Updates credentials for a specific resource.

5. **Application User**:
   - Accesses an API to retrieve data for a backend service.

6. **Guest User**:
   - Accesses a shared folder for a week to collaborate on a project.

7. **Security Officer**:
   - Approves an access request after verifying the user's identity.
   - Monitors login attempts for suspicious activity.

8. **Compliance Officer**:
   - Reviews a compliance report to ensure adherence to GDPR regulations.
   - Flags a user for accessing unauthorized resources.

9. **Help Desk User**:
   - Resets a user's password after verifying their identity.
   - Approves an access request on behalf of a manager.

10. **Super Admin**:
	- Overrides a security policy to grant emergency access to a resource.
	- Reviews and updates system-wide configurations.

---

### **Summary**
The user types and roles in a PAM system are designed to ensure **secure and efficient access management**. By categorizing users and defining their permissions, you can enforce security policies, comply with regulations, and maintain operational efficiency.
